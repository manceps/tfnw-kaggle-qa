The output from the nq_examples_iter iterator is an 'example' which holds a single question along with the candidate answers.  At the nq_examples_iter output level, tokenization to the Bert-Joint wordpiece level has not yet been performed.  **NOTE: the nq_examples_iter will by default skip over any candidate long answers that are subsets of other candidate long answers ( as indicated by the top_level=False indicator ).**\n","\n","Each 'example' contains the text of the question and an element called 'doc_tokens' which is a list of strings representing the long answer candidates all concatenated together:\n","*   The long answers have been split into whitespace delimited words\n","*   HTML characters have been removed\n","*   For each candidate long answer, the 'type' and 'position' of the answer in the text are recorded at the start in special tokens as in the Bert-Joint paper\n","*   'type' tells whether the long answer is a paragraph, table, list, or other as indicated by the first HTML character in the candidate answer\n","*   'position' indicates how many of the given answer type were seen previously in the document.  Ie, is the answer the first paragraph or the second, etc...\n","\n","After processing as above, the convert(example) line performs tokenization to the Bert-Joint wordpiece vocabulary and formats the candidate question-document pairs in the format required for Bert-Joint where you have the question first, then a SEP token, and then a fragment of the text where the text is stepped over in overlapping 128 token increments.  I am not sure, but I think in the original Bert-Joint, that they fed in the entire document but here we have been given a set of 'plausible' long answers and we only include those.  **Question:  do our long answer candidates in the dataset span the entire document? If not, would it be better to feed the whole document in?**\n","\n","After processing by convert(example), each json entry has been split into multiple InputFeatures objects which have the required tokenized input form for Bert-Joint as well as two identifiers:\n","*   example_index = the id from the json file\n","*   unique_id = example_index + 'a incrementing integer'\n","\n","The incrementing integer that contributes to unique_id is just an attempt to give unique ids to each question/document-fragment pair.  The unique_ids are, I think, not guaranteed to be unique unfortunately but they probably are.  It depends if any of the ids from the json file are close enough to each other.

code\n","In the item \"answer_type\", in the last lines of this block, it is responsible for storing the identified response type, which, according to [github project repository](https://github.com/google-research/language/blob/master/language/question_answering/bert_joint/run_nq.py) can be:\n","1. UNKNOWN = 0\n","2. YES = 1\n","3. NO = 2\n","4. SHORT = 3\n","5. LONG = 4\n","\n","#### Note from ChrisM\n","The other thing that compute_predictions does is look through the logits for the start and end indexes and finds the pairs of start/end indexes which seem most likely to be the short answer.  It does this by creating a score for the short answers based on the combined start + end logit scores and for some reason subtracting from this the logit scores for the initial CLS token in the Bert input.  The long span is determined from the best short answer.\n","\n","I am wondering here if we might be able to get some improvement by building an additional model to select the best short span in some other way rather than just taking the max logit values.  Maybe a tree ensemble, for example, could look at the logits in a different way and make a better decision for the short and long answers than what is coded
